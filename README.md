# Quick Blog: The cheetah of blogs

## What makes Quick Blog so fast?
- Lunr.js as a search engine for finding blog posts
- No bloat. Let's get content to our users quickly and painlessly
- Bittorrent ---- Wha?

## Current Project Status
This project is **in development**. It is likely that I won't get around to finishing it up completely for another few months because of a project which I'm developing which will enable this blog to be super fast. Stay posted for that!

## Development Setup
To setup quick-blog for developing you'll need to install a few global dependencies:
- Node.js
- grunt-cli: for build step
- mocha: for testing

Once you have those installed, just navigate to the home directory of the project and run:

      $ npm install .

And you're done!  Run `node index.js` and you've got the app running.

Note: Check `/lib/config/index.js` for port and configuration information
